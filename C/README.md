## fun.c
I remembered watching a youtube video about the game fizzbuzz. I originally
wanted to implement a solution such that it provides/generates the first N
associated values/words, but never got to it. It was probably due to laziness or
just wasn't motivated enough attempt it myself. But since I wanted to remind
myself of how allocating and freeing memory works in C, and how to dynamically
allocate and free an array of strings (char**) in C.

[ Well, I eventually got to it and implemented it... Also, I didn't really look
into the details fizzbuzz too much, there could be something I missed or
misread. And Similarly for checking for memory leaks on Valgrind. Sooooooo......
double check the reference..... And I might or might not update this in the
future... ]
