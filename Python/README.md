## flatten.py
I couldn't find a simple solution for flattening a nested list (in Python) that
uses very basic functions I'm familiar with, and is in a simple easy to
understand implementation. As the general purposed solutions (found on google)
either requires the use of higher order level functions that requires me to
lookup the corresponding documentations, or they use iteration within recursion.
Both require too much effort to read and is hard to understand what is going on
in the step by step process. Which makes it hard to get the basic overall idea
of the process. So what I did was just implement it in the most natural and
simplistic way possible, just a simple recursion.

[ At the very least, the idea and implementation is simple and easy to
understand for me... ]
